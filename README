I get easily confused. I have projects littered all over my hard drive that are maintained
in CVS, SVN, Git, or Mercurial. I get them mixed up and use the wrong command. I use the
slightly different syntax of one for another. I forget which one's pull also merges and
which one's doesn't.

To make matters worse, I don't use the advanced features in any of these systems much.
I just need something to keep track of my changes in such a way that I can share it with
others. And if I do need more advanced usage (which does happen) then I don't mind dropping
back to the actual tool.

What this project does is that it provides a simple command line tool — dwim — that does
what you mean. It detects what kind of working copy you're in and runs the command you
meant. It is not at all full-featured, and currently only supports a tiny subset of the
useful commands. I plan to add support for more, but not that much more.

It also assumes that you have already configured details such as what remote repository is
being used. It assumes you're committing to the main branch. It makes a lot of assumptions.
If you need more granularity, you're probably better off sticking to the underlying VCS tool.

This command is written in Javascript, it requires node to run. If this annoys you, feel free
to port it — it shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

Supported commands:

dwim up
    Gets the changes from the repository and merges them into your working copy.

dwim ci message
    Commits the changes you have made with the given, compulsory, message, and pushes them to
    the repository.

dwim add list of files
    Adds the list of files from the working copy to those being tracked. (Not implemented for
    CVS yet.)

dwim st
    Prints out the current status.

What I plan to add:

dwim rm list of files

dwim mv from to

dwim diff oldrev
